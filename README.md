# TreeMap/TreeSet (COMP2000 - Data Structures)

What it can do:
- Create an TreeMap and perform functions as a datatype Map
- Runs through a driver program testing all the Map functions
- Runs through a seuss function to print all distinct words as a TreeMap
- Runs through a seussSet function to print all distinct words as a TreeSet

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to btree directory
- remove other executable ```rm btree```
- run ```go build btree.go```
- run ```.\btree.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run btree.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
